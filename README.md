I'm a Fractional Principal Engineer at [Voice Swap](https://www.voice-swap.ai/) and a Fractional Senior Engineering Manager for Product Services at [Learning Pool](https://github.com/HT2-Labs)

At Learning Pool, I'm primarily working across three great engineering teams.

1. Ecosystem - Developing our Automation, Hub, and User Provisioning services along with our shared UI package.
2. LCMS/LRS - Developing our Learning Content Management System and Learning Record Store services.
3. Analytics - Developing our DataMart/Lakehouse and Analytics services.

Outside these roles, I'm currently developing and maintaining the following projects.

1. [Trust Reviews](https://trust-reviews.ryasmi.com/) - A service that provides 360 Peer Reviews to help measure trust.
2. [Rulr](https://github.com/ryasmi/rulr) - An NPM package that provides validation and unit conversion errors in TypeScript at compile-time.
3. [Baseroo](https://github.com/ryasmi/baseroo) - An NPM package that converts positive & negative float values from one base to another between 2-64.
4. [Shadow Roles](https://shadow-roles.ryasmi.com/) - A webpage to document the Shadow Role initiative used by colleagues at Learning Pool and friends beyond.

Along my journey from a Trainee Software Engineer to a Lead Software Engineer and now in my current roles, I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of great folks, a lot of tech and on some great projects - most notably during my time working on [Learning Locker](http://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker) and associated projects like [the Moodle xAPI Logstore plugin](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi).
