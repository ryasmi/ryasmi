I'm a Principal Engineer at [Voice Swap](https://www.voice-swap.ai/). Outside of this role, I'm currently developing and maintaining the following personal projects.

1. [Trust Reviews](https://trust-reviews.ryasmi.com/) - A service that provides 360 Peer Reviews to help measure trust.
2. [Rulr](https://github.com/ryasmi/rulr) - An NPM package that provides validation and unit conversion errors in TypeScript at compile-time.
3. [Baseroo](https://github.com/ryasmi/baseroo) - An NPM package that converts positive & negative float values from one base to another between 2-64.
4. [Shadow Roles](https://shadow-roles.ryasmi.com/) - A webpage to document the Shadow Role initiative used by friends and former colleagues.

I've also had the opportunity to collaborate with others on OSS, primarily on the following projects.

1. [Learning Locker](http://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker)
